# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the project

This project uses PostgreSQL to create a database and analyze employee information of the Pewlett Hackard company. The analysis involves figuring out which employees are retiring and employees who are eligible for mentorship programs to fill in vacancies left by the retirees.

### Purpose

Analyzing the employee information in the database enables the Pewlett Hackard company to prepare for a 'silver tsunami,' meaning a lot of retirements. To prepare for such a large number of retirements, the company needs to formulate plans and this analysis helps the company know which employees are retiring, how many they are, which departments and titles they have and how many positions the company has to fill after their retirements.
